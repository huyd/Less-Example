* A Complete HTML 5 + CSS 3 Solution with Customizable Color Theme ****
* Date: Oct. 22, 2011 *************************************************

***********
* My Goal *
***********
# CSS: My goal is to make CSS more manageable using Less.js (a Dynamic Stylesheet
  Language - http://lesscss.org/) so that in case customer wants to have different color theme,
  we can easily change the constant variables to switch colors for them.
# HTML5: Use HTML5 layout elements to have better markup for the latest browsers. However,
  to make same look and feel for older browsers. I've Polyfilled It! (http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/)

**************************
* Implementation Details *
**************************
# Makefile is provided to compile .less using Less Compiler (lessc). we could just
  use less.js to use .less files, but js runs on client-side and it is better to
  use minified (compressed) version of the compiled .css for production use.
# In order to run makefile, you need to have **lessc** and **YUI Compressor**.
# You must run "make less" and then run "make minify" to get the final minified version.

*************
* Polyfills *
*************
# Selectivizr.js used to polyfill CSS 3 Pseudo Class (jQuery used to support this library).
# Less.js used for dynamic stylesheet language.
# Html5Shiv used to reset HTML 5 elements.

********
* Test *
********
# Cross Browser Test is done using:
-- Google Chrome 14.0.835.202
-- FireFox 7.0.1
-- Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9

*******************
* To Change Color *
*******************
# To change color, open styles.less and change @main-bg or @main-bg-second to different colors.
# To apply those changed colors, you need to run "make less" & "make minify" under root folder.
# You need to change lessc and YUI Compressor location for your environment (in Makefile).
